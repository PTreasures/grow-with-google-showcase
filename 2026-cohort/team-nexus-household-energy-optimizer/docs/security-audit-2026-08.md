\# Security Audit — Dependency Vulnerability Scan



\*\*Date:\*\* August 2026

\*\*Performed by:\*\* Ashenafi Mekonnen Demssie (Cybersecurity Track)

\*\*Tool used:\*\* \[pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/)



\## Summary

Ran `pip-audit` against `backend/requirements.txt` and found 7 known

vulnerabilities across 3 packages.



\## Findings



| Package | Version | Vulnerability ID | Fix Version |

|---|---|---|---|

| flask | 3.0.3 | PYSEC-2026-2151 | 3.1.3 |

| flask-cors | 4.0.1 | PYSEC-2024-71 | 4.0.2 |

| flask-cors | 4.0.1 | PYSEC-2024-260 | 4.0.2 |

| flask-cors | 4.0.1 | PYSEC-2026-1383 | 6.0.0 |

| flask-cors | 4.0.1 | PYSEC-2026-1384 | 6.0.0 |

| flask-cors | 4.0.1 | PYSEC-2026-1385 | 6.0.0 |

| python-dotenv | 1.0.1 | PYSEC-2026-2270 | 1.2.2 |



\## Fix Applied

Upgraded all three packages in `requirements.txt` to their patched versions:

\- flask: 3.0.3 → 3.1.3

\- flask-cors: 4.0.1 → 6.0.0

\- python-dotenv: 1.0.1 → 1.2.2



\## Automation Added

Added `.github/workflows/security-check.yml`, which automatically runs

`pip-audit` and a secret scanner (`gitleaks`) on every future push and

pull request, so dependency vulnerabilities are caught continuously

rather than checked manually.



\## Additional Checks Performed

\- Manually reviewed the codebase for hardcoded secrets/API keys — none found

\- Confirmed `.env` files are properly excluded via `.gitignore`

\- Confirmed only safe `.env.example` placeholder files are committed
